Define two collections within the database: one for academic records and the other for co-curricular activities.
Design the schema for the academic records collection to include fields such as student ID, name, grades, subjects, and any other pertinent academic information.
Structure the schema for the co-curricular activities collection to incorporate fields like student ID, name, activity type, duration, achievements, etc.
